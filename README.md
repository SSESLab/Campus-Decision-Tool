# Code for Energy model and Optimization
The Python notebook file may be used to model different buildings similar to the (4) template files.  Building size can be adjusted and a local weather file can be input to model different sized buildings in different locations.  The Multi-Objective Optimization code can be used to define the Pareto Front using the results from the building energy model.

Instructions (Python File):
1) Download the anaconda notebook 
2) Download the desired weather file an save it in the 'Documents' folder
3) Download the template files and save it in 'Documents' folder
3) Run the code.  Be sure to have all helper libraries installed
